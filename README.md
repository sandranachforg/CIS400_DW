Group Members: Sandra Nachforg, Sahil, Mohammed, Hussaan

**1. Step: Idea Finding**

For our data warehouse project, we decided to build a data warehouse that collects social media mentions from Twitter, and headlines of diverse online newspapers for brands like Netflix, Coca-Cola, Starbucks, Nike and Tesla. Before the data is streamlined into our data warehouse, we are conducting a sentiment analysis on tweets and headlines to better understand the companyâ€™s current reputation within their sector. Our main KPI is the sentiment score for each online mention. With advanced text mining techniques, we hope to improve the sentiment score for all our clients by providing clear strategies concerning product development and quality.
